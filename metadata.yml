Title: Permeation of compounds across the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa
Description: Antibiotic compounds belonging to 16 chemical classes were evaluated
  for their ability to inhibit (IC50) three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (wild-type,
  efflux-deficient, and efflux-deficient and porinated). Results were used to classify
  compounds as permeable and non-permeable. In the original article, MexB ensemble
  docking calculations and molecular dynamics simulations of the outer membrane were
  used used as features for a predictive model, on top of intrinsic physicochemical
  parameters of the molecules. Here we build a baseline model to predict permeability using LazyQSAR.
